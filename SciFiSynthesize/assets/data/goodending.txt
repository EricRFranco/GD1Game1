With the power of the radio mutagen it created, you sent a signal far enough to reach another ship, a small vessel managed by three of your kind, sailing just outside the solar system.

Fex: Draex, is that you?

Ur: We thought you were dead!

Draex: How...how long has it been since I left?

Toyks: A few months, but it feels like forever since we left to search for you.

Draex: I was trapped down there...with those humans.

Fex: “Humans?” Is that what they’re called?

Ur: They didn’t try to hurt you, did they?

Draex: …

Toyks: Draex?

Draex: ...I had to kill them. They wouldn’t let me leave, so I had to fight my way out.

Fex: Draex…

Draex: I didn’t want to hurt them. They kept shooting at me, hitting me, like I was some kind of monster.

Ur: You don’t need to apologize…

Draex: I became that monster.

Toyks: No, you didn’t. If anything, they’re the monsters for locking you up and hunting you down.

Fex: You’re our friend, Draex. You got a good heart, but you know when you need to toughen up.

Ur: You did what you had to do to survive. If there was any other way, I’m sure you would’ve found it.

Draex: You guys...

Toyks: Let’s get you home, buddy. The longer we stay, the harder it’ll be to leave.

Draex: Everyone...thank you.
