Subject: MU7-G3N
Dr. Santiago Fisher

Everyone at INTERLOPER has been on-edge lately. Progress surrounding MU7-G3N’s abilities have halted; his biology is farther beyond our comprehension than we thought. We’ve tried every diagnostic on every piece of state-of-the-art equipment in this facility and not one can provide an analysis of MU7-G3N’s anatomy in a way that makes any remote sense.

There’s only one solution left, and it makes my stomach queasy just thinking about it. We’ll have to load MU7-G3N’s brain with electrical charges and see how his body reacts. If we can figure out what parts of the brain allow MU7-G3N to synthesize those mutagens, maybe we can come to understand the process and make the breakthrough we’ve been hoping for.
