INTERLOPER
Subject: MU7-G3N
Dr. Blake Reid

INTERLOPER has been in an uproar over MU7-G3N. After a heated debate, we finally decided to go ahead with Dr. Fisher’s plan. 

I am dumbfounded that, after all the years I had given to the peaceful research of extraterrestrial life, we are going back on the maintenance of ethics in this facility. But without the sole authority of MU7-G3N’s research, I am powerless.

This will be my last report as a member of INTERLOPER. As of today, I am resigning from my position and taking my talents to a facility where the pursuit of knowledge is not muddied by the addiction of breakthrough.
