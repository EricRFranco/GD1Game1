Subject: MU7-G3N

At last, MU7-G3N showed us how it creates these “mutagens.”

We placed a radio antennae and microphone in front of it, and MU7-G3N broke them down into subatomic components. In a matter of seconds it held a ball of molecules in its hands. A moment after, it sunk right into MU7-G3N’s skin, and suddenly he was sending radio transmissions throughout the facility. We were stunned.

Imagine the possibilities with an ability like that. If only we could let MU7-G3N free for a bit and see what kind of signal it could send from the radio tower outside. 

Maybe once we figure out the biology behind MU7-G3N’s power, we’ll be able to test it out ourselves!
