Is that...the exit?

I haven’t seen a sun in so long…

But why did I have to hurt them to see it again?

Why couldn’t they just let me go home?

...

Can I even go home after what I’ve done?

Will they even accept me once they learn everything?

...

Is it that easy to return like nothing ever happened?
