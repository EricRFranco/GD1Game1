INTERLOPER
Subject: MU7-G3N
Dr. Lawrence Harper

We found it twenty miles out from INTERLOPER, buried in a pile of debris and overloaded circuitry. The severed wires should’ve fried everything, but somehow, the alien beneath was unaffected, almost like its skin was a natural insulator.

Patrol returned with the unconscious alien an hour after their report came in. It will remain in stasis for a few days as we decide our best course of action. After a long, sleepless night of scouring our database, not one entry matched the description of our newest subject, who, from this point forward, shall be codenamed MU7-G3N.

It is remarkable see a lifeform get shot out of the sky, barrel through Earth’s atmosphere, and survive. It makes me all the more excited to figure out what MU7-G3N is truly capable of, and how these findings can improve the state of humanity as we know it.
