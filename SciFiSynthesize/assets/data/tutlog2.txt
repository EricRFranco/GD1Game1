Subject: MU7-G3N
Dr. Matt Bowers

MU7-G3N is as incredible as we thought. It has never been actively hostile as we began basic tests of its abilities. It has come to understand English in a remarkably short amount of time, and through breaking this communication barrier, we have been able to progress research at a rapid rate.

We spoke for hours about its homeworld and culture in an attempt to ease into details regarding the crash. When I provided the report from our scouts, it said:

“I severed the wires myself.”

I asked about the debris:

“Also my doing. I would not have survived without the electricity and a sheet of metal.”

MU7-G3N mentioned its ability to synthesize these...mutagens, as it calls them. Its species is able to use these mutagens to rebuild their genetic structure, allowing them to adapt to any situation given they have materials that complement.

However, that’s as far as we got with that train of thought. It seems he does not truly understand the physiology surrounding this phenomenon, and further testing may be required to uncover this mystery.
